This is a full stack application for managing to-do lists and tasks. It provides a solution for creating, organizing, and tracking tasks, all in one place. The application is built using MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), combining both front-end and back-end technologies for a complete end-to-end solution.
## Features (Updating)
- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and secure their data.
- Task Management: Users can view, edit, set to complete and delete tasks based on their needs.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
## Status
Please note that the application is currently in progress and not fully functional at this stage. There are still ongoing developments, improvements, and bug fixes planned to achieve the desired functionality and user experience. Updates will be made periodically to enhance its functionality, user experience, and performance.
